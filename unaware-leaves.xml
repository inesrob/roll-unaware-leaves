<abstract>
<t>This specification extends RFC6550 and RFC8505 to provide unicast and
   multicast routing services in a RPL domain to 6LNs that are plain hosts and
   do not participate to RPL.

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>The design of Low Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) is generally focused on
   saving energy, which is the most constrained resource of all. Other design
   constraints, such as a limited memory capacity, duty cycling of the LLN
   devices and low-power lossy transmissions, derive from that primary concern.
</t>


<t>The IETF produced the <xref target="RFC6550">"Routing Protocol for Low Power
   and Lossy Networks"</xref> (RPL) to provide IPv6 <xref target="RFC8200"/>
   routing services within such constraints.
   RPL is a Distance-Vector protocol, which, compared to link-state protocols,
   limits the amount of topological knowledge that needs to be installed and
   maintained in each node. In order to operate in constrained networks,
   RPL allows a Routing Stretch (see <xref target="RFC6687"/>), whereby routing
   is only performed along a DODAG as opposed to straight along a shortest path
   between 2 peers, whatever that would mean in a given LLN.
   This trades the quality of peer-to-peer (P2P) paths for a vastly reduced
   amount of control traffic and routing state that would be required to
   operate a any-to-any shortest path protocol.
   Finally, broken routes may be fixed lazily and on-demand, based on dataplane
   inconsistency discovery, which avoids wasting energy in the proactive repair
   of unused paths.

</t><t>
   In order to cope with lossy transmissions, RPL forms Direction-Oriented
   Directed Acyclic Graphs (DODAGs) using DODAG Information Solicitation (DIS)
   and DODAG Information Object (DIO) messages. For most of the nodes, though
   not all, a DODAG provides multiple forwarding solutions towards the Root of
   the topology via so-called parents.
   RPL is designed to adapt to fuzzy connectivity, whereby the physical topology
   cannot be expected to reach a stable state, with a lazy control that creates
   routes proactively but only fixes them when they are used by actual traffic.
   The result is that RPL provides reachability for most of the LLN nodes, most of
   the time, but may not really converge in the classical sense. RPL provides
   unicast and multicast routing services back to RPL-Aware nodes (RANs).
   A RAN will inject routes to itself using Destination Advertisement
   Object (DAO) messages sent to either parent-nodes in Storing Mode or to the
   Root indicating their parent in Non-Storing Mode.
   This process effectively forms a DODAG back to the device that is a subset of
   the DODAG to the Root with all links reversed.
</t>
<t>
   When a routing protocol such as RPL is used to maintain reachability within a
   Non-Broadcast Multi-Access (NBMA) subnet, some nodes may act as routers and
   participate to the routing operations whereas others may be plain hosts.
   In <xref target="RFC6550"/> terms, a host that is reachable over the RPL
   network is called a Leaf.
</t>
<t>
   <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-useofrplinfo">
   "When to use RFC 6553, 6554 and IPv6-in-IPv6"</xref> introduces the term
   RPL-Aware-Leaf (RAL) for a leaf that injects routes in RPL to manage the
   reachability of its own IPv6 addresses.
   In contrast, a RPL-Unaware Leaf (RUL) designates a leaf does not participate
   to RPL  at all. In that case, the 6LN is a plain host that
   needs an interface to its RPL router to obtain routing services over the LLN.

   This specification enables a RPL-Unaware Leaf (RUL) to announce itself as a
   host and request that 6LRs that accept the registration also inject the
   relevant routing information for the Registered Address in the RPL domain on
   its behalf.
   The unicast packet forwarding operation by the 6LR serving a Leaf 6LN is
   described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-useofrplinfo"/>.
</t>


<t>
   Examples of routing-agnostic 6LN may include lightly-powered sensors such as
   window smash sensor (alarm system), or the kinetically powered light switch.
   Other application of this specification may include a smart grid network that
   controls appliances - such as washing machines or the heating system - in the
   home. Applicances may not participate to the RPL protocol operated in the
   smart grid network but can still receive control packet from the smart grid.

<t>
   The "IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (IPv6 ND) Protocol" (NDP) suite
   <xref target="RFC4861"/> <xref target="RFC4862"/> was defined for transit
   media such a Ethernet, and relies heavily on multicast operations for address

<t>
   <xref target="RFC6775">
   "Neighbor Discovery Optimizations for 6LoWPAN networks"</xref>
   (6LoWPAN ND) adapts IPv6 ND for operations over energy-constrained LLNs.
   In particular, 6LoWPAN ND introduces a unicast host address registration
   mechanism that contributes to reducing the use of multicast messages that are
   present in the classical IPv6 ND protocol. 6LoWPAN ND defines a new Address
   Registration Option (ARO) that is carried in the unicast
   Neighbor Solicitation (NS) and Neighbor Advertisement (NA) messages between
   the 6LoWPAN Node (6LN) and the 6LoWPAN Router (6LR).
   6LoWPAN ND also defines the Duplicate Address Request (DAR) and Duplicate
   Address Confirmation (DAC) messages between the 6LR and the 6LoWPAN Border
   Router (6LBR).
   In an LLN, the 6LBR is the central repository of all the Registered Addresses
   in its domain.

   <t>

   <xref target="RFC8505"/> specifies the use of the R flag in the EARO by the
   Registering Node. With <xref target="RFC8505"/>,
   the Registering Node sets the R flag to indicate whether the 6LR should
   ensure reachability for the Registered Address, e.g., by means of routing
   or proxying ND. Adapted to this specification, this means that a 6LN operates
   as a RUL for an IPv6 address iff it sets the R flag in the NS(EARO) used to
   register the address.
   If the R flag is not set, then the Registering Node is expected to be a RAN
   that handles the reachability of the Registered Address by itself.
   Conversely, this document specifies a behavior of a RPL router acting as
   6LR for the registration 6LR that depends on the setting of the R flag in the
   NS(EARO). The RPL router generates a DAO message for the Registered Address
   upon an NS(EARO) iff the R flag in the EARO is set.
</t><t>

   The EARO also includes a sequence counter called Transaction ID (TID),
   which maps to the Path Sequence Field found in Transit Options in RPL DAO
   messages. This is the reason why the support of <xref target="RFC8505"/>
   by the RUL as opposed to only <xref target="RFC6775"/> is a prerequisite for
   this specification (more in <xref target="prereq6lp"/>). The EARO also
   transports an Opaque field and an "I" field that describes what the Opaque
   field transports and how to use it.

</t>
<t>
   <xref target="ln"/> specifies the use of the R flag, of the "I" field and of
   the Opaque field by a RUL.
</t><t>

   <xref target="I-D.ietf-6lo-ap-nd">"Address Protected Neighbor Discovery for
   Low-power and Lossy Networks"</xref>  protects the ownership of an address
   and enables a challenge that is leveraged by this specification.
   It also enables Source Address Validation by a 6LR that will drop the packets
   that are sourced at an address that is not registered.
</t>
</section>


<section anchor="upd" title="Updating RFC 6550">
<t>
   This document specifies a new behavior whereby a 6LR injects DAO messages
   for unicast addresses (see <xref target="op"/>) and multicast addresses
   (see <xref target= "multiop"/>) on behalf of leaves that are not aware of RPL.
   The Targets are exposed as External addresses. An IP-in-IP encapsulation that
   terminates at the border 6LR is used to remove RPL artifacts and compression
   techniques that may not be processed correctly outside of the RPL domain.
   This specification updates RPL <xref target="RFC6550"/> to mandate that
   External Routes are advertised using Non-Storing Mode signaling even in a
   Storing-Mode network in order to inform the root of the address of the 6LR
   that terminates the IP-in-IP tunnel.

</t><t>
   <xref target="RFC8505"/> specifies a periodic EDAR/EDAC exchange that
   takes place between the 6LR and the 6LBR. It is triggered by a NS(EARO)
   message and is intended to create and then refresh the corresponding state in
   the 6LBR for a lifetime that is indicated by the 6LN. Conversely, RPL
   <xref target="RFC6550"/> specifies a periodic DAO that maintains the routing
   state in the RPL network for a lifetime that is indicated by the source of
   the DAO. This means that there are two periodic messages that traverse the
   whole network to indicate that an address is still reachable, one to the Root
   and one to the 6LBR.

</t><t>
   This document synchronizes the liveness monitoring at the Root and the
   6LBR. A same value of lifetime is used for both, and a single keep alive
   message, the RPL DAO, traverses the RPL network. A new behavior is introduced
   whereby the RPL Root proxies the EDAR message to the 6LBR on behalf of the
   6LR (more in <xref target="upd2"/>). <xref target="RFC6550"/> is updated with
   new RPL Status values for use in DAO-ACK and DCO that map the 6LoWNAN ND
   values defined in Table 1 of <xref target="RFC8505"/>. The Resulting set is
   shown in <xref target="iana-ack-status"/>. The Status code are listed in the
   same order and DAO-ACK Status code of 128 maps to 6LoWPAN ND Status Code of 1.

</t><t>
   Section 5.3. of <xref target="RFC8505"/> introduces the Registration
   Ownership Verifier (ROVR) of a variable length from 64 to 256 bits. A ROVR is
   created by the Registering Node and associated to the registration of an IPv6
   Address. It is used to detect a duplication (DAD) and may also enable the
   Registering Node to prove its ownership of the Registered Address
   <xref target="I-D.ietf-6lo-ap-nd"/>.
   Section 6.7. of <xref target="RFC6550"/> introduces the RPL Control Message
   Options such as the RPL Target Option that can be included in a RPL Control
   Message such as the DAO.
   This document updates the RPL Target Option to optionally transport a ROVR,
   more in <xref target="tgt"/>. This enables the RPL Root to generate a full
   EDAR Message as opposed to a keep-alive EDAR that has restricted properties.

</t>


</section>

<section anchor="upd2" title="Updating RFC 8505">

<t>

   </t><t>
   This document updates <xref target="RFC8505"/> to introduce a keep-alive EDAR
   message and a keep-alive NS(EARO) message. The keep-alive messages are used
   for backward compatibility, when the DAO does not transport a ROVR as
   specified in <xref target="tgt"/>. The keep-alive messages have a zero ROVR
   field and can only be used to refresh a pre-existing state associated to the
   Registered Address. More specifically, a keep-alive message can only increase
   the lifetime and/or increment the TID of the existing state in a 6LBR.
   </t>
   <t>
   Upon the renewal of a 6LoWPAN ND registration, this specification changes the
   behavior of a RPL router acting as 6LR for the registration as follows: if
   the Root indicates the capability to proxy the EDAR/EDAC exchange to the 6LBR
   then the 6LR refrains from sending an EDAR message. If the Root is separated
   from the 6LBR, the Root regenerates the EDAR message to the 6LBR upon a
   DAO message that signals the liveliness of the Address.

  <section anchor="prereqv6" title="External Routes and RPL Artifacts">
   <t>
   RPL data packets are often encapsulated using IP-in-IP and in Non-Storing Mode,
   packets going down will carry an SRH as well. RPL data packets also typically
   carry a Hop-by-Hop Header to transport a RPL Packet Information (RPI)
   <xref target="RFC6550"/>. These additional headers are called RPL artifacts.
   When IP-in-IP is used and the outer headers terminate at a 6LR down the path
   (see <xref target="rtghc"/> for the format in Storing Mode),
   then the 6LR decapsulates the IP-in-IP and the packet that is forwarded to
   the external destination is free of RPL artifacts.

   </t><t>
   IP-in-IP to the 6LR MUST be used if the final destination cannot handle or
   ignore the RPL artifacts or the way they are compressed
   <xref target="RFC8138"/>. An External route indicates by default a node or a
   prefix that is not known to handle or ignore the RPL artifacts.
   The RECOMMENDED behaviour when using IP-in-IP to an External route is that
   the outer headers terminate at the 6LR that injected the External route.
   Non-Storing Mode signaling MUST be used to inject External routes to the
   Root in order to advertise the 6LR that is associated to a RUL.

   </t><t>
   In order to save the IP-in-IP encapsulation and to support Storing Mode of
   operation, it is preferred that the 6LN can ignore an RPI and consume a
   routing header in both the native and <xref target="RFC8138"/>-compressed
   forms.
   In order to enable IP-in-IP to a 6LN in Non-Storing Mode, it is also of
   interest that the 6LN supports decapsulating IP-in-IP in both forms.

    (see section 4.2 of <xref target="RFC8505"/>).
    With this specification the ROVR is the remainder of the RPL Target Option.

  <t>
   This specification enables to save the exchange of Extended Duplicate
   Address messages, EDAR and EDAC, from a 6LN all the way to the 6LBR across a
   RPL mesh, for the sole purpose of refreshing an existing state in the 6LBR.
   Instead, the EDAR/EDAC exchange is proxied by the RPL Root upon a DAO message
   that refreshes the RPL routing state. To achieve this, the lifetimes and
   sequence counters in 6LoWPAN ND and RPL are aligned. In other words, the Path
   Sequence and the Path Lifetime in the DAO message are taken from the
   Transaction ID and the registration lifetime in the NS(EARO) message from the
   6LN.
 </t><t>
   In that flow, the RPL Root acts as a proxy to refresh the state in the 6LBR.
   The proxy operation applies to both RUL and RAN. This means that in a RPL
   network where the function is enabled, refreshing the state in the 6LBR is
   the responsibility of the Root. Consequently, only addresses that are
   injected in RPL will be kept alive by the RPL Root. If an additional routing
   protocol is deployed on a same network, that additional routing protocol may
   need to handle the keep alive procedure for the addresses that it serves.

   </t><t>
   From the perspective of the 6LN, the registration flow happens transparently;
   it is not delayed by the proxy RPL operation, so the device does not need to
   change the amount of time it waits based upon whether RPL proxy operation
   happens or not.
    </t><t>
        On the first registration, illustrated in <xref target="fReg1"/>, from
        the perspective of the 6LR in Non-Storing Mode, the Extended
        Duplicate Address message takes place as prescribed by
        <xref target="RFC8505"/>. When successful, the flow
        creates a Neighbor Cache Entry (NCE) in the 6LR, and the 6LR injects
        the Registered Address in RPL using DAO/DAO-ACK exchanges all the way to
        the RPL DODAG Root.
        The protocol does not carry a specific information that the Extended
        Duplicate Address messages were already exchanged, so the Root proxies
        them anyway.
    </t><t>
    Note that any of the functions 6LR, Root and 6LBR might be collapsed in a
    single node, in which case the flow above happens internally, and possibly
    through internal API calls as opposed to messaging.
    </t>
 <section anchor="rnsm" title="In RPL Non-Storing-Mode">
    <t>
    In Non-Storing Mode, the flows can be nested as illustrated in
    <xref target="fReg1"/> and it is possible to carry information such as an
    updated lifetime from the 6LBR all the way to the 6LN.

    A re-registration is performed by the 6LN to maintain the NCE in the 6LR
    alive before lifetime expires. Upon a re-registration, as
    illustrated in <xref target="fReg2"/>,
    the 6LR redistributes the Registered Address NS(EARO) in RPL.
    </t> <t>
    This causes the RPL DODAG Root to refresh the state in the 6LBR with a
    keep-alive EDAC message.
    The keep-alive EDAC lacks the Registration Ownership Verifier (ROVR)
    information, since it is not present in RPL DAO messages, but the EDAC
    message sent in response by the 6LBR contains the actual value of the ROVR
    field for that registration.
    This enables the RPL Root to perform the proxy-registration for
    the Registered Address and attract traffic captured over the backbone by the
    6BBR and route it back to the device.

    <t>In case of an error on the keep-alive EDAR flow, the error SHOULD be
    returned in the DAO-ACK - if one was requested - using the mapping of RPL
    Status and 6LoWPAN Status values discussed in <xref target="upd"/>.

    </t> <t>
    If the Root could not return the negative Status in the DAO-ACK then it
    sends an asynchronous Destination Cleanup Object (DCO) message
    <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-efficient-npdao"/> to the 6LR indicating the
    issue with the mapped Status value. Note that if both are used in a short
    interval of time, the DAO-ACK and DCO messages are not guaranteed to arrive
    in the same order at the 6LR. So the 6LR must still expect a DAO-ACK even if
    it received a DCO while it was waiting for an acknowledgement for a short
    period of time, but the negative status in the DCO supercedes a positive
    status in the DAO-ACK regardless of the order in which they are received.

    </t> <t>
    Upon the DAO-ACK - or the DCO if it arrives first - the 6LR responds to the
    RUL with a NA(EARO) and the 6LoWPAN ND Status value that is mapped from the
    RPL status in the RPL  message. An asynchronous DCO is also mapped in an
    asynchronous NA(EARO) to the RUL with a mapped Status value.

    In Storing Mode, the DAO-ACK is optional. When it is used, it is generated
    by the RPL parent, which does not need to wait for the grand-parent to send
    the acknowledgement. A successful DAO-ACK is not a guarantee that the DAO
    has yet reached the Root or that the keep-alive EDAR has succeeded.

<section anchor="oper" title="Operation">
<section anchor="ln" title="By the 6LN">
<t>
  This specification does not alter the operation of a 6LoWPAN ND-compliant 6LN,
  and a RUL is expected to operate as follows:
<list style="symbols"><t>
   The 6LN obtains an IPv6 global address, for instance using autoconfiguration
   <xref target="RFC4862"/> based on a Prefix Information Option (PIO)
   <xref target="RFC4861"/> found in a Router Advertisement message
   or by some other means such as DHCPv6 <xref target="RFC3315"/>.

</t><t>
   Once it has formed an address, the 6LN (re)registers its address periodically,
   within the Lifetime of the previous registration, as prescribed by
   <xref target="RFC6775"/>.
</t><t>
   A 6LN acting as a RUL sets the R flag in the EARO whereas
   a 6LN acting as a RAN does not set the R flag as prescribed by
   <xref target="RFC8505"/> section 5.1.

</t><t>
   Upon each consecutive registration, the 6LN increases the TID field in the
   EARO, as prescribed by <xref target="RFC8505"/> section 5.2.

</t><t>
   The 6LN can register to more than one 6LR at the same time. In that case, a
   same value of TID is used for each registration.

</t><t>
   The 6LN may use any of the 6LRs to which it register to forward its packets.
   Using a 6LR to which the 6LN is not registered may result in packets dropped
   by a Source Address Validation function.


</t>

</list>
</t>

<t>
   Even without support for RPL, a RUL may be aware of opaque values to be
   provided to the routing protocol. If the RUL has a knowledge of the RPL
   Instance the packet should be injected into, then it SHOULD set the Opaque
   field in the EARO to the RPLInstanceID, else it MUST leave the Opaque field
   to zero. In any fashion the 6LN MUST set the "I" field to zero to indicate
   that topological information to be passed to a routing process as specified
   in <xref target="RFC8505"/> section 5.1.
</t><t>
   A RUL is not expected to produce RPL artifacts in the data packets, but it
   MAY do so. for instance, if the RUL has a minimal awareness of the RPL
   Instance and can build an RPI. A RUL that places an RPI in a data packet
   MUST indicate the RPLInstanceID that corresponds to the RPL Instance the
   packet should be injected into. All the flags and the Rank field are set
   to zero as specified by section 11.2 of <xref target="RFC6550"/>.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="lr" title="By the 6LR">
<t>
   Also as prescribed by <xref target="RFC8505"/>,
   the 6LR generates a DAR message upon reception of a valid NS(EARO)
   message for the registration of a new IPv6 Address by a 6LN. If the Duplicate
   Address exchange succeeds, then the 6LR installs a Neighbor Cache Entry (NCE).
   If the R flag was set in the EARO of the NS message, and this 6LR can
   manage the reachability of Registered Address, then the 6LR sets the R flag
   in the EARO of the NA message that is sent in response.
</t>

<t>From then on, the 6LN periodically sends a new NS(EARO) to refresh the NCE
   state before the lifetime indicated in the EARO expires, with TID that is
   incremented each time till it wraps in a lollipop fashion (see section 5.2.1
   of <xref target="RFC8505"/> which is fully compatible with section 7.2 of
   <xref target="RFC6550"/>). As long as the R
   flag is set and this router can still manage the reachability of Registered
   Address, the 6LR keeps setting the R flag in the EARO of the response NA
   message, but the exchange of Extended Duplicate Address messages is skipped.

</t> <t>
   The Opaque field in the EARO hints the 6LR on the RPL Instance that should
   be used for the DAO advertisements, and for the forwarding of packets sourced
   at the registered address when there is no RPL Packet Information (RPI) in
   the packet, in which case the 6LR SHOULD add one to the packet.
   if the "I" field is not zero, then the 6LR MUST consider that the Opaque
   field is zero. If the Opaque field is not set to zero, then it should
   carry a RPLInstanceID for the Instance suggested by the 6LN.
   If the 6LR does not participate to the associated Instance, then the 6LR MUST
   consider that the Opaque field is empty.
   If the Opaque field is empty, the 6LR is free to use the default Instance
   (zero) for the registered address or to select an Instance of its choice;
   else, that is if the 6LR participates to the suggested Instance, then the
   6LR SHOULD use that Instance for the registered address.
</t>
<t>
   Upon a successful NS/NA(EARO) exchange: if the R flag was set in the
   EARO of the NS message, then the 6LR SHOULD inject the Registered Address in
   RPL by sending a DAO message on behalf of the 6LN; else the 6LR MUST NOT
   inject the Registered Address into RPL.
</t><t>
  The DAO message advertising the Registered Address MUST be constructed as
  follows:
  <list style="symbols">
  <t>The Registered Address is placed in a RPL Target Option in the DAO
  message as the Target Prefix, and the Prefix Length is set to 128;
  </t><t>
  the External 'E' flag in the Transit Information Option (TIO) associated to
  the Target Option is set to indicate that the 6LR redistributes an external
  target into the RPL network.  When the Root has to use an IP-in-IP
  <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-useofrplinfo"/>, then this flag indicates the
  IP-in-IP should be addressed to this node;

  </t><t>
  the Path Lifetime in the TIO is computed from the Lifetime in the EARO Option
  to adapt it to the Lifetime Units used in the RPL operation. Note that if the
  lifetime is 0, then the 6LR generates a No-Path DAO message that cleans up
  the routes down to the Address of the 6LN;
  </t><t>
  the Path Sequence in the TIO is set to the TID value found in the EARO option;
  </t><t>
  Additionally, in Non-Storing Mode the 6LR indicates one of its global IPv6
  unicast addresses as the Parent Address in the TIO.
  </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   If a DAO-ACK is not requested, or has a Status that is less than 128,
   indicating the DAO was accepted, respectively by a parent in Storing Mode
   or by the Root in non-Storing Mode,, the 6LR replies with a
   NA(EARO) to the RUL with a status of 0 (Success).
</t>
<t>
   In case of a DAO-ACK or a DCO with a status of 132 (Validation Requested) the
   6LR challenges the 6LN for ownership of the address, as described in section
   6.1 of <xref target="RFC8505"/>. If the challenge succeeds then the
   operations continue as normal. In particular a DAO message is generated upon
   the  NS(EARO) that proves the ownership of the address. If the challenge
   failed the 6LR MUST refrain from injecting the address in RPL and may take
   actions to protect itself against DoS attacks by a rogue 6LN, see
   <xref target="security-considerations"/>
</t>
<t>
   Other status values above 128 indicate that the 6LR failed to inject the
   address into the RPL network. In that case the the 6LR MUST send a
   NA(EARO) to the RUL with the mapped Status value. If for any other reason the
   6LR fails to inject the address into the RPL network, the 6LR SHOULD send a
   NA(EARO) to the RUL with a status of 2 (Out of Storage) which indicates a
   possibility to retry later.
</t>
<t>
   If a 6LR receives a valid NS(EARO) message with the R flag reset and the 6LR
   was redistributing the Registered Address due to previous NS(EARO) messages
   with the flag set, then it MUST stop injecting the address.
   It is up to the Registering Node to maintain the corresponding route from then
   on, either keeping it active by sending further DAO messages, or destroying
   it using a No-Path DAO.
</t>
<t>
   Upon a DCO message indicating that the address of a RUL should be removed
   from the routing table, the 6LR issues an asynchronous NA(EARO) to the RUL
   with the mapped Status value.
</t>

<section anchor="Root" title="By the RPL Root">


<t>
   In RPL Storing Mode of Operation (MOP), the DAO message is propagated from
   child to parent all the way to the Root along the DODAG, populating routing
   state as it goes. In Non-Storing Mode, The DAO message is sent directly to the
   RPL Root.
   Upon reception of a DAO message, for each RPL Target option that creates or
   updates an existing RPL state:
   <list style="symbols">
   <t>
   the Root notifies the 6LBR using an internal API if they are co-located, or
   performs an EDAR/EDAC exchange on behalf of the 6LR if they are separated.
   If the Target option transports a ROVR, then the Root MUST use it to build
   a full EDAR message as the 6LR would. Else, a keep-alive EDAR is used with
   the ROVR field set to zero.
   </t>
   <!--t>
   In a topology where the RPL Root and the 6LBR are directly connected at the
   Link-Layer, the Root may refresh the 6LBR with an NS(EARO) - respectively a
   keep-alive NS(EARO) - on behalf of the 6LN that owns the address indicated in
   the Target Option as opposed to an EDAR - respectively a keep-alive EDAR -
   on behalf of the 6LR.
   </t-->
   </list>
</t><t>
  An EDAR <!--and the NS(EARO)--> message MUST be constructed as follows:
  <list style="symbols">
  <t>
  The Target IPv6 address from in the RPL Target Option is placed in the
  Registered Address field of the EDAR message and in the Target field of the NS
  message, respectively;
  </t><t>
  the Registration Lifetime is adapted from the Path Lifetime in the TIO by
  converting the Lifetime Units used in RPL into units of 60 seconds used in the
  6LoWPAN ND messages;
  </t><t>
  the RPL Root indicates its own MAC Address as Source Link Layer Address (SLLA)
  in the NS(EARO);
  </t><t>
  the TID value is set to the Path Sequence in the TIO and indicated with an ICMP
  code of 1 in the EDAR message;
  </t><t>
  when present in the RPL Target option, the ROVR field is used as is in the
  EDAR and the ICMP Code Suffix is set to the appropriate value as shown in
  Table 4 of <xref target="RFC8505"/> depending on the length of the ROVR field.
  If it is not present the ROVR field in the EDAR is set to zero indicating that
  this is a keep-alive EDAR. The actual value of the ROVR for that registration
  is expected from the 6LBR in the response EDAC.
  <!-- and used in the proxy NS(EARO).-->
  </t>
  </list>
</t>

<t>
  Upon a Status value in an EDAC message that is not "Success", the Root SHOULD
  destroy the formed paths using either a DAO-ACK (in Non-Storing Mode) or a DCO
  downwards as specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-efficient-npdao"/>.
  Failure to destroy the former path would result in Stale routing state and
  local black holes if the address belongs to another party elsewhere in the
  network. The RPL Status value that maps the 6LowpAN ND status value MUST be
  placed in the DCO.

<section anchor="lbr" title="By the 6LBR">


<t>
   Upon reception of an EDAR message with the ROVR field is set to zero
   indicating a keep-alive EDAR, the 6LBR checks whether an entry exists for the

   entry as prescribed in section 4.2.1. of <xref target="RFC8505"/>.

</t><t>
   If the entry does not exist, the 6LBR does not create the entry, and answers
   with a Status "Removed" in the EDAC message.

   If the entry exists but is not fresher, the 6LBR does not update the entry,
   and answers with a Status "Success" in the EDAC message.
</t><t>
   If the entry exists and the TID in the DAR message is fresher, the 6LBR
   updates the TID in the entry, and if the
   lifetime of the entry is extended by the Registration Lifetime in the DAR
   message, it also updates the lifetime of the entry.
   In that case, the 6LBR replies with a Status "Success" in the DAC message.

<section anchor="multiop" title="Protocol Operations for Multicast Addresses">

    <t> Section 12 of <xref target="RFC6550"/> details the RPL support for
    multicast flows. This support is not source-specific and only operates as
    an extension to the Storing Mode of Operation for unicast packets. Note that
    it is the RPL model that the multicast packet is passed as a Layer-2 unicast
    to each if the interested children.
    This remains true when forwarding between the 6LR and the listener 6LN.
    </t>
    <t>
    <xref target="RFC2710">"Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) for IPv6"</xref>
    and its updated version <xref target="RFC3810">
    "Multicast Listener Discovery Version 2 (MLDv2) for IPv6"</xref> provide an
    interface for a listener to register to multicast flows.
    MLDv2 is backwards compatible with MLD, and adds in particular the
    capability to filter the sources via black lists and white lists.
    In the MLD model, the router is a "querier" and the host is a multicast
    listener that registers to the querier to obtain copies of the particular
    flows it is interested in.


    </t><t>
     On the first registration, as illustrated in <xref target="fReg3"/>, the
     6LN, as an MLD listener, sends an unsolicited Report to the 6LR in order to
     start receiving the flow immediately. Since multicast Layer-2 messages are
     avoided, it is important that the asynchronous messages for unsolicited
     Report and Done are sent reliably, for instance using an Layer-2
     acknoledgement, or attempted multiple times.

    </t><t>
     The 6LR acts as a generic MLD querier and generates a DAO for the multicast
     target. The lifetime of the DAO is set to be in the order of the Query
     Interval, yet larger to account for variable propagation delays.

    </t><t>
     The Root proxies the MLD echange as listener with the 6BBR acting as the
     querier, so as to get packets from a source external to the RPL domain.
     Upon a DAO with a multicast target, the RPL Root checks if it is
     already registered as a listener for that address, and if not, it performs
     its own unsolicited Report for the multicast target.

    The difference with the format presented in Figure 19 of

          elided. In Storing Mode, it is placed as the single entry in an
          SRH-6LoRH as the first 6LoRH. Since there is a single entry so the
          SRH-6LoRH Size is 0. In this particular example, the 6LR address can
          be compressed to 2 bytes so a Type of 1 is used.
          It results that the total length of the SRH-6LoRH is 4 bytes.

          In Non-Storing Mode, the encapsulation from the Root would be similar
          to that represented in <xref target="rtghc"/> with possibly more hops
          in the SRH-6LoRH and possibly multiple SRH-6LoRHs if the various
          addresses in the routing header are not compressed to the same format.
          Note that on the last hop to the parent 6LR, the RH3 is consumed and
          removed from the compressed form, so the use of Non-Storing Mode vs.
          Storing Mode is indistinguishable from the packet format.

          Follows the RPI-6LoRH and then the IP-in-IP 6LoRH. When the
          IP-in-IP 6LoRH is removed, all the router headers that precede it are
          also removed.

          The Paging Dispatch <xref target="RFC8025"/> may also be removed if
          there was no previous Page change to a Page other than 0 or 1, since
          the LOWPAN_IPHC is encoded in the same fashion in the default Page 0
          and in Page 1. The resulting packet to the destination is the inner
          packet compressed with <xref target="RFC6282"/>.
